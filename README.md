# Game Theory Visualizer

The Game Theory Visualizer is a web-based application designed to help users understand and analyze various game theory concepts through interactive visualizations. It provides an intuitive interface for exploring different game scenarios, strategies, and outcomes.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore classic game theory models such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Nash Equilibrium, and more through dynamic visual representations.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust game parameters to observe how changes affect outcomes and strategies.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive immediate visual feedback on the effects of different strategies and decisions.
- **Educational Resources**: Access explanations and tutorials to deepen your understanding of game theory concepts.
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Engage in game scenarios with other users to experience strategic interactions firsthand.
- **AI Opponents**: Challenge AI-driven players to test and refine your strategies.

## Multiplayer Gameplay

The Game Theory Visualizer offers a multiplayer mode where users can engage in strategic games with others. This feature allows players to experience real-time interactions and understand the dynamics of decision-making in competitive and cooperative scenarios.

**How to Play Multiplayer Games**:

1. **Create or Join a Game Room**: Initiate a new game session or join an existing one.
2. **Select a Game Scenario**: Choose from a variety of game theory models to play.
3. **Make Strategic Decisions**: Interact with other players, make decisions, and observe outcomes.

## AI Opponents

For users interested in solo play or testing strategies, the application provides AI-driven opponents. These AI players simulate human decision-making processes, offering a challenging environment to refine your understanding of game theory principles.

**Playing Against AI**:

1. **Select a Game Scenario**: Choose a game model to play against the AI.
2. **Set AI Difficulty**: Adjust the AI's skill level to match your preference.
3. **Engage in Gameplay**: Make decisions and observe how the AI responds, learning from each interaction.
